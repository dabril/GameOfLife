The Game of Life is in short a simulation of a group of cells. At every step
in time, often referred to in the game as a tick, cells live or die depending
on their surroundings.

There are four rules which are applied simultaneously to all the cells in the
game.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by
under-population. 
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
generation. 
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
overcrowding. 
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if
by reproduction.
